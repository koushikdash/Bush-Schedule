A Java Swing application that simplifies university bus schedules by showing only the routes, stops, and timings relevant to a single student.  
Users input their name, department, batch, and section, then navigate through a guided interface to select the day and bus route.  
The system displays relevant stop details and timings for working days (Sundayâ€“Thursday) and shows a dedicated "Off Days" window for Fridays and Saturdays.
